### Restaurant survey app
For project 2 in the Web Development Immersive class I decided to Construct a full-stack restaurant Survey app. As the user, you have the ability to CREATE restaurants, each restaurant has a given location. The user also has the ability to READ the restaurant that they created via the index page. From the index page the user can click on a specific restaurant and UPDATE the information about it. From the restaurant's information page, the user can DELETE the restaurant ffrom the database.
